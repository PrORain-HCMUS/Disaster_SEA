    "# A. INTRODUCTION\n",
    "- This notebook is the result of a Data Science project where we processed with datasets of natural disasters occured in the area of Southeast Asia from 2000 to the early 2024. We aimed to reviewing the recent circumstance of the local area in the last 2 decades, withdrawing valuable conclusions, visualizing some noteworthy parts and last but not least: giving some promising predictions."

    "# B. ABOUT THE DATA\n",
    "- We decided to approach this project by the dataset of EM-DAT. EM-DAT (Emergency Events Database) is a global database of disasters developed by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). The main objective of EM-DAT is to record and provide comprehensive information about major natural and man-made disasters worldwide, ranging from climate-related events (hurricanes, floods, droughts, etc.) to industrial accidents and armed conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- EM-DAT is an important resource for researchers, governments, and international organizations when studying and preparing for disasters. However, it's noteworthy that this database records events based on criteria such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - At least 10 deaths (including dead and missing).\n",
    "    - At least 100 people affected.\n",
    "    - International assistance is required or an emergency declaration is requested from the government.\n",
    "    - The level of disasters\n",
