# Disaster_SEA
Natural Disasters in Southeast Asia (2000â€“2024): A Data Science project analyzing trends, visualizing impacts, and predicting future risks for improved regional preparedness and resilience


## Introduction:

This notebook is the result of a Data Science project where we processed with datasets of **natural disasters occured in the area of Southeast Asia from 2000 to the early 2024**. We aimed to **reviewing** the recent circumstance of the local area in the last 2 decades, **withdrawing** valuable conclusions, **visualizing** some noteworthy parts and last but not least: **giving** some promising predictions.


## About the Data:

We decided to approach this project by the dataset of [EM-DAT](https://www.emdat.be/). **EM-DAT** (Emergency Events Database) is a global database of disasters developed by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). The main objective of EM-DAT is to **record and provide comprehensive information** about major natural and man-made disasters worldwide, ranging from climate-related events (hurricanes, floods, droughts, etc.) to industrial accidents and armed conflicts. 

EM-DAT is an important resource for researchers, governments, and international organizations when studying and preparing for disasters. However, it's **noteworthy** that this database records events based on criteria such as:
- At least **10 deaths** (including dead and missing).
- At least **100 people affected**.
- **International assistance** is required or an **emergency declaration** is requested from the government.
- The **level** of disasters
- And so on

We have conducted a version of this dataset on Kaggle: [Disaster-1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hoangvu128/disaster-1  ), which consists of `attributes.csv` and `disaster_sea.xlsx`. These files are features' explanations and the main data, respectively.

## About Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrORain-HCMUS/Disaster_SEA
cd https://github.com/PrORain-HCMUS/Disaster_SEA
```

### 2. Install essential dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Running the Notebook

Once you have opened the main notebook `src\22120085_22120108_22120461.ipynb`, you can run the cells step by step by selecting the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by using the `Run` button in the toolbar.

Make sure to run all the necessary cells in order (from top to bottom) to ensure that the data is loaded, processed, and visualized correctly.
